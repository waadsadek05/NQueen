# ♛ N-Queen AI Solver  

An Artificial Intelligence project that solves the **N-Queen Problem** using multiple search algorithms implemented in **Python** with a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.

> The N-Queen problem aims to place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

## 🧠 Implemented Algorithms  

- **Backtracking**  
- **Hill Climbing**  
- **Best First Search**  
- **Cultural Algorithm**  

Each algorithm uses a different approach to explore the solution space and reach a valid board configuration.
