♛ N-Queen AI Puzzle Solver

This project is an Artificial Intelligence application that solves the N-Queen problem using multiple search algorithms implemented in Python with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

The goal is to place N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

🚀 Features

Interactive GUI

Visual solution for the N-Queen problem

Comparison between different AI algorithms

Easy to run and modify

🤖 Algorithms Implemented

Backtracking

Hill Climbing

Best First Search

Cultural Algorithm

Each algorithm tries to find a valid configuration of queens using a different search strategy.
